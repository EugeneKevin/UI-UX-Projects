****PRESENTATION****

Hi everyone ! 

My name is Kevin Eugene, and I am 22 years old. I study Computer Science and Multimedia at Telecom ParisTech. My passions are design and storytelling.

I value simplicity and efficiency in design. Tools need to be easy and fun to use, focused on doing one particular task in the best possible way. They need to empower our productivity.

Lately, I have been working on trying to rethink the user experience when using smartphones and computers, with productivity - the capacity of doing many things in a short time - as a guideline.

On my GitHub Profile, you will find the prototypes I have been designing in my free time (for now, they are only .pdf files, but I am working on it). Feel free to ask any questions, I would love to debate with you about any of the ideas that are highlighted in the given files. :)

As you may notice, the prototypes are not complete yet. I will try to update and finish them as soon as possible.
